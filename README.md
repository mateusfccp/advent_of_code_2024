Repository with the programs used to complete the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

## How to run the programs

You can run the program by calling the main Dart program in `bin`, passing a
folder as argument.

The folder should have the following structure:

```
data/
  day_1
  day_2
  ...
```

Where `day_n` is the input for the n-th day.

This repository provides a `data` folder with the input I received for each
day.
