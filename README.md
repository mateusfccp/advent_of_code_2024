Repository with the programs used to complete the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

## How to run the programs

You can run the program by calling the main Dart program in `bin`, passing a
folder as argument.

The folder should have the following structure:

```
data/
  day_01/
    puzzle_1
	puzzle_2
  day_02/
    puzzle_1
	puzzle_2
  ...
```

Where `puzzle_1` and `puzzle_2` are the input given for the first and second
puzzles of the day, respectively.
